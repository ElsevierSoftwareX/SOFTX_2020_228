# SurfRCaT

## What is it?

The surf-camera remote calibration tool (SurfRCaT) allows for the rectification of imagery from any coastal camera that views structures identifiable in lidar data.

## How do I use it?
1) Download the folder xxxxxxx...
2) Obtain imagery from your desired camera and seperate into images 
3) Obtain initial estimates of camera location, elevation, and azimuth (I like to use Google Earth).
4) Launch SurfRCaT and follow the instructions!
